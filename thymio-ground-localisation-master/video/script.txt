Recent progress in electronics has allowed the construction of affordable mobile robots.

This opens many new opportunities, in particular in the educational context.

However, the lack of long-range sensing abilities has prevented these robots from performing global localization without external aids.

This severely limits their use, for example to teach spatial reasoning or develop artistic activities.

In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem, using only infrared ground sensors, dead-reckoning, and a visual pattern on the ground.

Our approach builds on a recursive Bayesian filter, of which we demonstrate two implementations: a dense Markov Localization and a particle-filter-based Monte Carlo Localization.

Both implementations allow accurate localization.
It is demonstrated here on an abstract painting.
Our system works on a large range of images, from random binary patterns to children's drawings.

In this video, the robot localizes itself after travelling a dozen of centimeters.

If kidnapped, the robot will quickly relocalize itself.
	video runs

These results show a solution to the localization of inexpensive robots.
By enabling a new range of educational activities, it strongly increases the value of robots for education.
